# Main

## Module Declarations
The main.rs needs to declare all the top level modules:
    * data
    * events
    * game_loop
    * init
    * status
    * subroutines
    * turn
    * utils
    * win_lose_condtions

Main then needs to call the `game_loop` function, which will call all the other functions and handle running the game.

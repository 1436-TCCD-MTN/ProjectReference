# `Events`

## `events.rs`
Handles the Event Checking Logic. Declares the sub mods checks, weather, wagon, party, combat.

## checks.rs

### `FUNCTION check_for_riders(game_state: BYREF MUTABLE GameState)`
* Runs the checks to see if riders are spotted:
    * num = a random number between 1 and 10
    * a = (miles_traveled / 100 - 4)^2
    * b = (a + 72) / (a * 12)
    * c = b - 1
    * Riders spotted if num <= c
* Runs a check to see if they _look_ hostile: random number between 0 and 1 < 0.8
* Sets a flag, true for looks hostile, false for looks friendly
* Output:
> TACTICS
> () RUN (2) ATTACK (3) CONTINUE (4) CIRCLE WAGONS

* After the output, determine if the riderss are actually hostile:
    * generate random number between 0 and 1, > 0.2 then flag = !flag to flip it
* Take user input and resolve based on their choice.

### `FUNCTION check_for_mountains(game_state: BYREF MUTABLE GameState) `
* Runs the checks to see if the player has reached the mountain ranges. There are two that they can encounter, the South Pass and the Blue Mountains. This event can only happen once the player has passed 950 miles.
* Once the player has reached 950 miles, the chance for the event to occur is calculated as follows:
    * num = a random number between 1 and 10
    * a = (miles_traveled / 100 - 15)^2
    * b = (a + 72) / (a + 12)
    * c = 9 - b
    * If num <= c, then the player has reached the mountain ranges.

### `FUNCTION check_for_event(game_state: BYREF MUTABLE GameState)`
This function is the main entry point for all the random events. It will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and choose a random event based on the number generated.
* Call the get_random_int function with min=1 and max=100.
* Call the appropriate function based on the random number generated:

|Number Range|Event|
|---|---|
|1-3|bandits|
|4-13|wild_animals|
|14-15|wagon_fire|
|16-21|wagon_breakdown|
|22-31|wagon_swamped|
|32-41|weather_event|
|42-46|hail|
|47-51|fog|
|52-53|broken_arm|
|54-55|wandering_ox|
|56-57|lost_son|
|58-59|snake_bite|
|60-64|ox_injury|
|65-69|unsafe_water|
|70-75|helpful_natives|
|76-100|illness_chance|

* Based on event, either return None, or return the result of the event (Either None or Some(CauseOfDeath))
